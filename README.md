# Movie_Recom
A hybrid recommender system which uses both content based approach (using cosine similarity) and rating based approach.

In this python code we can call the combinedRecommender() function to call both of our recomenders. By setting the last condition as you need you can call first one second one or even both recommenders.

The codes are pretty simple and you can use it in anyway you like. All the needed explanations are given as comment inside codes.
